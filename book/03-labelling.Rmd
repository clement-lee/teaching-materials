# Labelling {#label}


| Environment | Where label? | When labelling | When referencing |
|:-----:|:-------:|:---------:|:-------:|
| Chapter/section | After name | `{#chapter-name}` | `\@ref(chapter-name)` |
| Equation | Before/after equation | `(\#eq:euler)` | `\@ref(eq:euler)` |
| Theorem | 1st line of environment | `::: {.theorem #identity}` | `\@ref(thm:identity)` |
| Proof | Can't label | N/A | N/A |
| Figure | 1st line of environment | ` ```{r plot-cars} ` | `\@ref(fig:plot-cars)` |

It's confusing!

* When labelling: apart from equations, don't add the required prefix; relatedly, don't use colon `:` in the label name or things will break.
* When referencing: apart from chapters/sections, add the required prefix; always use `\@ref()` so that referencing works in both html & pdf.
* In addition to colon `:`, avoid using underscore `_` in labels as things **might** break; the hyphen `-` is the best bet.
