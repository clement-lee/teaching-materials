Theorem 1.1 (Euler's identity) \\(e^{i\\pi}+1=0\\) The proof of Theorem 1.1 is as below: Proof. \\[\\begin{align*} e^{i\\pi}+1&amp;=\\cos\\pi+i\\sin\\pi+1\\\\ &amp;=-1+i\\times0+1=0 \\end{align*}\\] The proof is written in the same kind of environments as the theorem.

When labelling When referencing Chapter/section After name {#chapter-name} \\@ref(chapter-name) Equation Before/after equation (\\#eq:euler) \\@ref(eq:euler) Theorem 1st line of environment ::: {.theorem #identity} \\@ref(thm:identity) Proof Can’t label N/A N/A Figure 1st line of environment ```{r plot-cars} \\@ref(fig:plot-cars) It’s confusing! When labelling: apart from equations, don’t add the required prefix; relatedly, don’t use colon : in the label name or things will break. When referencing: apart from chapters/sections, add the required prefix; always use \\@ref() so that referencing works in both html &amp; pdf. In addition to colon :, avoid using underscore _ in labels as things might break; the hyphen - is the best bet.
