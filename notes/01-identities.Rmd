# Mathematical Identities {#chp-identity}

This is Chapter \@ref(chp-identity).

## LaTeX environments
We can use `equation` envrionment as in LaTeX.

\begin{equation}
  e^{i\pi}+1=0
  (\#eq:euler)
\end{equation}
Equation \@ref(eq:euler) is the Euler's identity.


## Bookdown environments
These start with `::: {. }` and end with `:::`.

::: {.theorem name="Euler's identity" #euler-identity}
$e^{i\pi}+1=0$
:::

The proof of Theorem \@ref(thm:euler-identity) is as below:

::: {.proof}
\begin{align*}
  e^{i\pi}+1&=\cos\pi+i\sin\pi+1\\
  &=-1+i\times0+1=0
\end{align*}
:::

The proof is written in the same kind of environments as the theorem.
